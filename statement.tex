\section{Thesis Statement}

This thesis explores two problems in balancing software performance and energy consumption in server-class systems: 1) meeting application performance goals while minimizing energy consumption, and 2) running applications as energy-efficiently as possible (maximizing the work to energy consumption ratio).
We address the first problem by using control theory to meet performance goals while tuning system settings, such as DVFS frequencies, core allocations, or hardware power caps, to optimize energy consumption.
We treat the second as a classification problem, using low-level hardware counter metrics with machine learning approaches to predict the most energy-efficient system settings at runtime.
